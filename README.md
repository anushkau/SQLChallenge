# SQLChallenge

This repository has my solutions to SQL case studies from Data With Danny. Shoutout to Danny Ma for these insightful challenges! 👋🏻

Each folder includes:
- README: Problem statement & datasets
- SQL script: Schema, table creation, and data loading
- MD files: SQL queries for each challenge question

Feel free to drop in your feedbacks/concerns on any of the questions, you can directly reach out to me at anushkaubriani0@gmail.com
